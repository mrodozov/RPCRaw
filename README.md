## Description:

This is a model of a "test bench" for testing newly constructed Resistive plate chambers (RPCs) currently installed in the RE+-4 part of the Endcap of the CMS Experiment, CERN.
The best example is always a picture: https://photos.app.goo.gl/N7QoqtUkm4FMfS4X9 it's the blue bench behind Francesco. This is the CERN bench, and there are two more - one in Belguim and one in India. The chambers for RE4 are the same, but the testing benches were different.
This model uses parameters like whats the distance from chamber to chamber, what are the chambers under test layout, which are the reference chambers for the test , what were the environmental conditions like preasure and humidity and performs the same analysis for the three different setups.
It aims to fairly measure the hit data from the tests using the same method for all chambers regardless their build origin and to calculate each chamber's efficiency.
